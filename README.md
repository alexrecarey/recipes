Recipes
=======

My favorite (food) recipes. 

Some original, some put together from various sources. Most of them are modified to my liking.


History
=======

I have tried various different software programs and apps to store and order my recipes, but 
most of them keep your recipes unaccesible. They also have no change management. Ideally, I 
wanted something that could store my recipes in plain text (markdown) for maximum portability.
One day it hit me, git + github met all of my needs! All of git's goodness married to github's
storage and accesibility == heaven.


Future improvements
===================

* Develop a recipe "schema" to enable processing of recipe files with other tools
* Develop tools that read recipes files to do ingredient hunts etc
